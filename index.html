	<hr>
	<img src="metro 2033.jpg">
	<p class="text"> Based on the Dmitry Glukhovsky novel of the same name, Metro 2033 is set in a post-apocalyptic near-distant future Moscow after a nuclear war killed billions of people, forcing survivors into the metro tunnels below ground to escape the radiation. Players take on the role of Artyom, a 24-year-old survivor that was born before the war but has grown up in the Metro tunnels. In 2033, the Exhibition (a converted former Metro station) is attacked by the Dark Ones, a group of mysterious creatures that live in the tunnels, forcing Artyom to leave his home base and travel to the Metro capitol Polis to seek help.</p>
    <p class="text">Fighting off mutants, mutated creatures, bandits, and the neo-Nazi Fourth Reich, Artyom travels from station to station until he reaches Polis. There, it's revealed that the Dark Ones have a nest in the botanical gardens and Colonel Miller has a plan to blow up the hive. Depending on choices made throughout the game, Metro 2033 has two possible endings. In the canonical ending, the Colonel and Artyom are successful in destroying the hive, only to learn that the Dark Ones attacked in self-defense and ultimately wanted peace. In the alternative ending, Artyom learns of the Dark One's true nature in time and prevents the attack on the hive. </p>
